## Development
It's build using [Bun](https://bun.sh) with the [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) framework.
To run it locally, you only need to install Bun and run:
```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Notes
For simplicity an account was created having the authority over an example NFT Collection which was also created, both on Solana Devnet.
